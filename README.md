## 1. Introduction

The introduction outlines the motivation for the research, highlighting the challenges of evaluating claims in large text corpora and the high computational costs associated with current methods. It presents the alternative approach proposed in the paper, which focuses on selective retrieval and entailment, and summarizes the key contributions of the study.

## 2. Related Work

This section reviews relevant literature in the field of claim verification and long-form text summarization. It discusses various approaches and datasets, including FABLE, LONGEVAL, and benchmarks for long-context claim verification. The related work provides context and highlights the novelty of the proposed method.

## 3. Background

The background section offers a technical overview of previous work in the area of claim verification and summarization evaluation. It discusses human evaluation methodologies, automatic evaluation metrics, fact verification in long-context documents, and retrieval and entailment models.

## 4. Methods and Experimental Setup

This section details the data collection and preparation process, including the scraping of data from 256 books and the creation of an entailment dataset. It describes the implementation of the pipeline, the retrieval models (BM25 and DPR), and the entailment model (BART-large fine-tuned on MNLI). The experimental setup also covers the oracle scenario and the rationale behind using depth 2 and depth 3 summaries.

## 5. Results

The results section presents the findings of the retrieval and entailment experiments. It includes visual placeholders for examples of entailed and contradicted sentences, and compares the performance of BM25 and DPR retrieval models. The pipeline performance is also evaluated against the oracle scenario.
