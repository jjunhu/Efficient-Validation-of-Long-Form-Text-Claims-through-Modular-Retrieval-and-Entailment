Pros\\nPassmore, uncle of the sick woman and mainstay of the forlorn little\\nConsadine household, was always full of enthusiasm. \\\"Just a few nails\\nand a little wrappin' of twine'll make it all right,\\\" he informed his\\nniece. \\\"I stopped a-past and borried the nails and the hammer from Jeff\\nDawes; I mighty nigh pounded my thumb off knockin' in nails with a rock\\nan' a sad-iron last week.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Looks like nobody ain't got no sense,\\\" returned Laurella Consadine\\nungratefully. \\\"Even you, Unc' Pros--while you borryin' why cain't ye\\nborry whole things that don't need mendin'?\\\"\\n\\nOut of the shadows that hoarded the further end of the room came a woman\\nwith a little bundle in her arm which had evidently created the\\nnecessity for the borrowed cradle.\\n\\n\\\"Laurelly,\\\" the nurse hesitated, \\\"I wouldn't name it to ye whilst ye was\\na-sufferin,' but I jest cain't find the baby's clothes nowhars. I've\\ndone washed the little trick and wrapped her in my flannen petticoat. I\\ndo despise to put anything on 'em that anybody else has wore ... hit\\ndon't seem right. But I've been plumb through everything, an' cain't\\nfind none of her coats. Whar did you put 'em?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I didn't have no luck borryin' for this one,\\\" complained the sick woman\\nfretfully. \\\"Looks like everybody's got that mean that they wouldn't lend\\nme a rag ... an' the Lord knows I only ast a _wearin'_ of the clothes\\nfor my chillen. Folks can make shore that I return what I borry--ef the\\nLord lets me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ain't they nothin' to put on the baby?\\\" asked Mavity Bence, aghast.\\n\\n\\\"No. Hit's jest like I been tellin' ye, I went to Tarver's wife--she's\\ngot a plenty. I knowed in reason she'd have baby clothes that she\\ncouldn't expect to wear out on her own chillen. I said as much to her,\\nwhen she told me she was liable to need 'em befo' I did. I says, 'Ye\\ncain't need more'n half of 'em, I reckon, an' half'll do me, an' I'll\\nreturn 'em to ye when I'm done with 'em.' She acted jest as\\n\\n\\nselfish--said she'd like to know how I was goin' to inshore her that it\\nwouldn't be twins agin same as 'twas before. Some folks is powerful mean\\nan' suspicious.\\\"\\n\\nAll this time the nurse had been standing with the quiet small packet\\nwhich was the storm centre of preparation lying like a cocoon or a giant\\nseed-pod against her bosom.\\n\\n\\\"She's a mighty likely little gal,\\\" said she finally. \\\"Have ye any hopes\\no' gittin' anything to put on her?\\\"\\n\\nThe woman in the bed--she was scarcely more than a girl, with shining\\ndark eyes and a profusion of jetty ringlets about her elfish, pretty\\nlittle face--seemed to feel that this speech was in the nature of a\\nreproach. She hastened to detail her further activities on behalf of\\nthe newcomer.\\n\\n\\\"Consadine's a poor provider,\\\" she said plaintively, alluding to her\\nabsent husband. \\\"Maw said to me when I would have him that he was a poor\\nprovider; and then he's got into this here way of goin' off like. Time\\nthings gets too bad here at home he's got a big scheme up for makin' his\\nfortune somewhars else, and out he puts. He 'lowed he'd be home with a\\nplenty before the baby come. But thar--he's the best man that ever was,\\nwhen he's here, and I have no wish to miscall him. I reckon he thought I\\ncould borry what I'd need. Biney Meal lent me enough for the little un\\nthat died; but of course some o' the coats was buried with the child;\\nand what was left, Sis' Elvira borried for her baby. I was layin' off to\\ngo over to the Deep Spring neighbourhood when I could git a lift in that\\ndirection--the folks over yon is mighty accommodative,\\\" she concluded,\\n\\\"but I was took sooner than I expected, and hyer we air without a\\nstitch, I've done sont Bud an' Honey to Mandy Ann Foncher's mebby\\nthey'll bring in somethin'.\\\"\\n\\nThe little cabin shrank back against the steep side of the mountain as\\nthough half terrified at the hollow immensity of the welkin above, or\\nthe almost sheer drop to the valley five hundred feet beneath. A sidling\\nmountain trail passed the front of its rail fence, and stones\\ncontinually rolled from the upper to the lower side of this highway.\\n\\nThe day was darkening rapidly. A low line of red still burned behind the\\nmassive bulk of Big Unaka, and the solemn purple mountains raised their\\npeaks against it in a jagged line. Within die single-roomed cabin the\\n\\n\\nrich, broken light from the cavernous fireplace filled the smoke-browned\\ninterior full of shadow and shine in which things leaped oddly into\\nlife, or dropped out of knowledge with a startling effect. The four\\ncorners of the log room were utilized, three of them for beds, made by\\nthrusting two poles through auger holes bored in the logs of the walls,\\nsetting a leg at the corner where these met and lacing the bottom with\\nhickory withes. The fourth had some rude planks nailed in it for a\\ntable, and a knot-hole in one of the logs served the primitive purpose\\nof a salt-cellar. A pack of gaunt hounds quarrelled under the floor, and\\nthe sick woman stirred uneasily on her bed and expressed a wish that her\\nemissaries would return.\\n\\nUncle Pros had taken the cradle to a back door to get the last of the\\nevening sun upon his task. One would not have thought that he could hear\\nwhat the women were saying at this distance, but the old hunter's ears\\nwere sharp.\\n\\n\\\"Never you mind, Laurelly,\\\" he called cheerfully. \\\"Wrop the baby up some\\nfashion, and I'll hike out and get clothes for her, time I mend\\nthis cradle.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ef that ain't just like Unc' Pros!\\\" And the girlish mother laughed out\\nsuddenly. You saw the gypsy beauty of her face. \\\"He ain't content with\\nborryin' men's truck, but thinks he can turn in an' borry coats 'mongst\\nthe women. Well, I reckon he might have better luck than what I did.\\\"\\n\\nAs she spoke a small boy and girl, her dead brother's children, came\\nclattering in from the purple mysteries of dusk outside, hand clasped in\\nhand, and stopped close to the bed, staring.\\n\\n\\\"Mandy Ann, she wouldn't lend us a thing,\\\" Bud began in an aggrieved\\ntone. \\\"I traded for this--chopped wood for it--and hit was all she would\\ngive me.\\\" He laid a coarse little garment upon the ragged coverlet.\\n\\n\\\"That!\\\" cried Laurella Passmore, taking it up with angrily tremulous\\nfingers. \\\"My child shain't wear no sech. Hit ain't fittin' for my baby\\nto put on. Oh, I wisht I could git up from here and do about; I'd git\\nsomethin' for her to wear!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Son,\\\" said Mrs. Bence, approaching the bedside, \\\"air ye afeared to go\\nover as far as my house right now?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I ain't skeered ef Honey'll go with me,\\\" returned the boy doubtfully,\\nas he interrogated the twilit spaces beyond the open cabin door.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"Well, you go ask Pap to look in the green chist and send me the spotted\\ncaliker poke that he'll find under the big bun'le. Don't you let him\\ngive you that thar big bun'le; 'caze that's not a thing but seed corn,\\nand he'll be mad ef it's tetched. Fell Pap that what's in the spotted\\npoke ain't nothin' that he wants. Tell him it's--well, tell him to look\\nat it before he gives it to you.\\\"\\n\\nThe two little souls scuttled away into the gathering dark, and the\\nneighbour woman sat down by the fire to nurse the baby and croon and\\nawait the clothing for which she had sent.\\n\\nShe was not an old woman, but already stiff and misshapen by toil and\\nthe lack of that saving salt of pride, the stimulation of joy, which\\nkeeps us erect and supple. Her broad back was bent; her hands as they\\nshifted the infant tenderly were knotted and work-worn. Mavity Bence was\\na widow, living at home with her father, Gideon Himes; she had one child\\nleft, a daughter; but the clothing for which she had sent was an outfit\\nmade for a son, the posthumous offspring of his father; and the babe had\\nnot lived long enough to wear it.\\n\\nOutside, Uncle Pros began to sing at his work. He had a fluty old tenor\\nvoice, and he put in turns and quavers that no ear not of the mountains\\ncould possibly follow and fix. First it was a hymn, all abrupt, odd,\\nminor cadences and monotonous refrain. Then he shifted to a ballad--and\\nthe mountains are full of old ballads of Scotland and England, come down\\nfrom the time of the first settlers, and with local names quaintly\\nsubstituted for the originals here and there.\\n\\n  \\\"She's gwine to walk in a silken gownd,\\n  An' ha'e plenty o' siller for to spare,\\\"\\n\\nchanted the old man above the little bed he was repairing.\\n\\n\\\"Who's that you're a-namin' that's a-goin' to have silk dresses?\\\"\\ninquired Laurella, as he entered and set the mended cradle down by\\nthe bedside.\\n\\n\\\"The baby.\\\" he returned. \\\"Ef I find my silver mine--or ruther _when_ I\\nfind my silver mine, for you know in reason with the directions Pap's\\nGrandpap left, and that word from Great Uncle Billy that helped the\\nInjuns work it, I'm bound to run the thing down one o' these days--when\\nI find my silver mine this here little gal's a-goin' to have everything\\n\\n\\nshe wants--ain't ye, Pretty?\\\"\\n\\nAnd, having made a bed in the cradle from some folded covers, he lifted\\nthe baby with strange deftness and placed it in.\\n\\n\\\"See thar,\\\" he called their attention proudly. \\\"As good as new. And ef I\\ngit time I'm a-goin' to give it a few licks o' paint.\\\"\\n\\nHands on knees, he bent to study the face of the new-born, that\\ncountenance so ambiguous to our eyes, scarce stamped yet with the common\\nseal of humanity.\\n\\n\\\"She's a mighty pretty little gal,\\\" he repeated Mavity Bence's words.\\n\\\"She's got the Passmore favour, as well as the Consadine. Reckon I\\nbetter be steppin' over to Vander's and see can I borry their cow. If\\nit's with you this time like it was with the last one, we'll have to\\nhave a cow. I always thought if we'd had a fresh cow for that other one,\\nhit would 'a' lived. I know in reason Vander'll lend the cow for a\\nspell\\\"--Uncle Pros always had unbounded confidence in the good will of\\nhis neighbours toward himself, since his own generosity to them would\\nhave been fathomless--\\\"I know in reason he'll lend hit, 'caze they ain't\\ngot no baby to their house.\\\"\\n\\nHe bestowed one more proud, fond look upon the little face in the\\nborrowed cradle, and walked out with as elated a step as though a queen\\nhad been born to the tribe.\\n\\nIn the doorway he met Bud and Honey, returning with the spotted calico\\npoke clutched fast between them.\\n\\n\\\"I won't ask nothin' but a wearin' of em for my child,\\\" Laurella\\nConsadine, born Laurella Passmore, reiterated when the small garments\\nwere laid out on the bed, and the baby was being dressed. \\\"They're\\nmighty fine, Mavity, an' I'll take good keer of 'em and always bear in\\nmind that they're only borried.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" returned Mavity Bence, with unwonted firmness, as she put the\\nnewcomer into the slip intended for her own son. \\\"No, Laurelly, these\\nclothes ain't loaned to you. I give 'em to this child. I'm a widder, and\\nI never look to wed again, becaze Pap he has to have somebody to do for\\nhim, an' he'd just about tear up the ground if I was to name sech a\\nthing. I'm mighty glad to give 'em to yo' little gal. I only wisht,\\\" she\\nsaid wistfully, \\\"that hit was a boy. Ef hit was a boy, mebbe you'd give\\n\\n\\nhit the name that should 'a' went with the clothes. I was a-goin' to\\ncall the baby John after hit's pappy.\\\"\\n\\nLaurella Consadine lay quiescent for a moment, big black eyes studying\\nthe smoky logs that raftered the roof. Then all at once she laughed,\\nwith a flash of white teeth.\\n\\n\\\"I don't see why Johnnie ain't a mighty fine name for a gal,\\\" she said.\\n\\\"I vow I'm a-goin' to name her Johnnie!\\\"\\n\\nAnd so this one of the tribe of borrowing Passmores wore her own\\nclothing from the first. No borrowed garment touched her. She rejected\\nthe milk from the borrowed cow, fiercely; lustily she demanded--and\\neventually received--her own legitimate, unborrowed sustenance.\\n\\nPerhaps such a beginning had its own influence upon her future.\\n\\nTHE BIRTH OF AN AMBITION\\n\\nAll day the girl had walked steadily, her bare feet comforted by the\\nwarm dust, shunning the pebbles, never finding sham stones in the way,\\nmaking friends with the path--that would always be Johnnie. From the\\nlittle high-hung valley in the remote fastnesses of the Unakas where she\\nwas born, Johnnie Consadine was walking down to Cottonville, the factory\\ntown on the outskirts of Watauga, to find work. Sometimes the road wound\\na little upward for a quarter of a mile or so; but the general tendency\\nwas persistently down.\\n\\nIn the gray dawn of Sunday morning she had stepped from the door of that\\nroom where the three beds occupied three corners, and a rude table was\\nrigged in the fourth. It might almost seem that the same hounds were\\nquarrelling under the floor that had scrambled there eighteen years\\nbefore when she was born. At first the way was entirely familiar to her.\\nIt passed few habitations, and of those the dwellers were not yet\\nabroad, since it was scarce day. As time went on she got to the little\\nsettlement at the foot of the first mountain, and had to explain to\\neverybody her destination and ambition. Beyond this, she stopped\\noccasionally for direction, she met more people; yet she was still in\\nthe heart of the mountains when noon found her, and she crept up a\\nwayside bank and sat down alone to eat her bite of corn pone.\\n\\nGuided by the instinct--or the wood-craft--of the mountain born and\\nbred, she had sought out one of the hermit springs of beautiful\\nfreestone water that hide in these solitudes. When she had slaked her\\nthirst at its little ice-cold chalice, she raised her head with a low\\nexclamation of rapture. There, growing and blowing beside the cool\\n\\n\\nthread of water which trickled from the spring, was a stately pink\\nmoccasin flower. She knelt and gazed at it with folded hands, as one\\nbefore a shrine.\\n\\nWhat is it in the sweeping dignity of these pointed, oval,\\nparallel-veined leaves, sheathed one within another, the clean column of\\nthe bloom stalk rising a foot and a half perhaps above, and at its tip\\nthe wonderful pink, dreaming Buddha of the forest, that so commands the\\nheart? It was not entirely the beauty of the softly glowing orchid that\\ncharmed Johnnie Consadine's eyes; it was the significance of the flower.\\nSomehow the finding this rare, shy thing decking her path toward labour\\nand enterprise spoke to her soul of success. For a long time she knelt,\\nher bright uncovered head dappled by a ray of sunlight which filtered\\nthrough the deep, cool green above her, her face bent, her eyes\\nbrooding, as though she prayed. When she had finished her dinner of corn\\npone and fried pork, she rose and parted with almost reverent fingers\\nthe pink wonder from its stalk, sought out a coarse, clean handkerchief\\nfrom her bundle and, steeping it in the icy water of the spring, lapped\\nit around her treasure. Not often in her eighteen summers had she found\\nso fine a specimen. Then she took up her journey, comforted and\\nstrangely elated.\\n\\n\\\"Looks like it was waiting right there to tell me howdy,\\\" she murmured\\nto herself.\\n\\nThe keynote of Johnnie Consadine's character was aspiration. In her\\ncabin home the wings of desire were clipped, because she must needs put\\nher passionate young soul into the longing for food, to quiet the\\ncravings of a healthy stomach, which generally clamoured from one\\nblackberry season to the other; the longing for shoes, when her feet\\nwere frostbitten; the yet more urgent wish to feed the little ones she\\nloved; the pressing demand, when the water-bucket gave out and they had\\nto pack water in a tin tomato can with a string bail; the dull ache of\\nmortification when she became old enough to understand their position as\\nthe borrowing Passmores. Yet all human desire is sacred, and of God; to\\ndesire--to want--to aspire--thus shall the individual be saved; and\\nsurely in this is the salvation of the race. And Johnnie felt vaguely\\nthat at last she was going out into a world where she should learn what\\nto desire and how to desire it.\\n\\nNow as she tramped she was conning over her present plans. Again she saw\\nthe cabin at home in that pitchy black which precedes the first\\nleavening of dawn, and herself getting up to start early on the long\\n\\n\\nwalk. Her mother would get up too, and that was foolish. She saw the\\nslight figure stooping to rake together the embers in the broad\\nchimney's throat that the coffee-pot might be set on. She remonstrated\\nwith the little mother, saying that she aimed not to disturb\\nanybody--not even Uncle Pros.\\n\\n\\\"Uncle Pros!\\\" Laurella echoed from the hearthstone, where she sat on her\\nheels, like a little girl playing at mud-pies. Johnnie smiled at the\\nmemory of how her mother laughed over the suggestion, with a drawing of\\nslant brows above big, tragic dark eyes, a look of suffering from the\\nmirth which adds the crown to joyousness. \\\"Your Uncle Pros he got a\\nrevelation 'long 'bout midnight as to just whar that thar silver mine is\\nthat's been dodgin' him for more'n forty year. He come a-shakin' me by\\nthe shoulder--like I reckon he's done fifty times ef he's done it\\nonce--and telling me that he's off to make all our fortunes inside of a\\nweek. He said if you still would go down to that thar old fool cotton\\nmill and hire out, to name it to you that Shade Buckheath would stand\\nsome watchin'. Your Uncle Pros has got sense--in streaks. Why in the\\nworld you'll pike out and go to work in a cotton mill is more than I\\ncan cipher.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To take care of you and the children,\\\" the girl had said, standing tall\\nand straight, deep-bosomed and red-lipped, laughing back at her little\\nmother. \\\"Somebody's got to take care of you-all, and I just love to\\nbe the one.\\\"\\n\\nLaurella Consadine, commonly called in mountain fashion by her maiden\\nname of Laurella Passmore, scrambled to her feet and tossed the dark\\ncurls out of her eyes.\\n\\n\\\"Aw--law--huh!\\\" she returned carelessly. \\\"We'll get along; we always\\nhave. How do you reckon I made out before you was born, you great big\\nsomebody? What's the matter with you? Did you fail to borry a frock for\\nthe dance over at Rainy Gap? Try again, honey--I'll bet S'lomy Buckheath\\nwould lend you one o' her'n.\\\"\\n\\nThat was it; borrowing--borrowing--borrowing till they were known as the\\nborrowing Passmores and became the jest of the neighbourhood.\\n\\n\\\"No, I couldn't stand it,\\\" the girl justified herself. \\\"I had obliged to\\nget out and go where money could be earned--me, that's big and stout\\n\\n\\nand able.\\\"\\n\\nAnd sighingly--yet light-heartedly, for with Laurella Consadine and\\nJohnnie there was always the quaint suggestion of a little girl with a\\ndoll quite too big for her--the mother let her go. It had been just so\\nwhen Johnnie would have her time for every term of the \\\"old field\\nhollerin' school,\\\" where she learned to read and write; even when she\\npersisted in going to Rainy Gap where some charitably inclined northern\\nchurch maintained a little school, and pushed her education to dizzy\\nheights that to mountain vision appeared \\\"plumb foolish.\\\"\\n\\nThat morning she had cautioned her mother to be careful lest they waken\\nthe children, for if the little ones roused and began, as the mountain\\nphrase has it, \\\"takin' on,\\\" she scarcely knew how she should find heart\\nto leave them. The children--there was the thing that drove. Four small\\nbrothers and sisters there were; with little Deanie, the youngest, to\\nmake the painfully strong plea of recent babyhood. Consadine, who never\\ncould earn money, and used to be from home following one wild scheme or\\nanother most of the time, was gone these two years upon his last\\ndubious, adventurous journey; there was not even his intermittent\\nassistance to depend upon. Johnnie was the man of the family, and she\\nshouldered her burden bravely, declaring to herself that she would yet\\nhave a chance, which the little ones could share.\\n\\nShe had kissed her mother, picked up her bundle and got as far as the\\ndoor, when there came a spat of bare feet meeting the floor, a pattering\\nrush, and Deanie's short arms went around her knees, almost tripping\\nher up.\\n\\n\\\"I wasn't 'sleep--I was 'wake the whole time,\\\" whispered the baby,\\nlifting a warm, pursed mouth for a kiss. \\\"Deanie'll be good an' let you\\ngo, Sis' Johnnie. An' then when you get down thar whar it's all so\\nsightly, you'll send for Deanie, 'cause deed and double you couldn't\\nlive without her, now could ye?\\\" And she looked craftily up into the\\nface bent above her, bravely choking back the tears that wanted to drown\\nher long speech.\\n\\nJohnnie dropped her bundle and caught up the child, crushing the warm,\\nsoft, yielding little form against her breast in a very passion of\\ntenderness.\\n\\n\\\"Deed and double I couldn't,\\\" she whispered back. \\\"Sister's goin' to\\nearn money, and Deanie shall have plenty of good things to eat next\\nwinter, and some shoes. She shan't be housed up every time it snows.\\n\\n\\nSis's goin' to--\\\"\\n\\nShe broke off abruptly and kissed the small face with vehemence.\\n\\n\\\"Good-bye,\\\" she managed to whisper, as she set the baby down and turned\\nto her mother. The kindling touch of that farewell warmed her resolution\\nyet. She was not going down to Cottonville to work in the mill merely;\\nshe was going into the Storehouse of Possibilities, to find and buy a\\nchance in the world for these poor little souls who could never have it\\notherwise.\\n\\nBefore she kissed her mother, took up her bundle and trudged away in the\\nchill, gray dawn, she declared an intention to come home and pay back\\nevery one to whom they were under obligations. Now her face dimpled as\\nshe remembered the shriek of dismay Laurella sent after her.\\n\\n\\\"Good land, Johnnie Consadine! If you start in to pay off all the\\nborryin's of the Passmore family since you was born, you'll ruin\\nus--that's what you'll do--you'll ruin us.\\\"\\n\\nThese things acted themselves over and over in Johnnie's mind as,\\nthroughout the fresh April afternoon, her long, free, rhythmic step, its\\nmorning vigour undiminished, swung the miles behind her; still present\\nin thought when, away down in Render's Gap, she settled herself on a\\nrock by the wayside where a little stream crossed the road, to wash her\\nfeet and put on the shoes which she had up to this time carried with\\nher bundle.\\n\\n\\\"I reckon I must be near enough town to need 'em,\\\" she said regretfully,\\nas she drew the big, shapeless, cowhide affairs on her slim, brown,\\ncarefully washed and dried feet, and with a leathern thong laced down a\\nwide, stiff tongue. She had earned the money for these shoes picking\\nblackberries at ten cents the gallon, and Uncle Pros had bought them at\\nthe store at Bledsoe according to his own ideas. \\\"Get 'em big enough and\\nthere won't be any fussin' about the fit,\\\" the old man explained his\\ntheory: and indeed the fit of those shoes on Johnnie's feet was not a\\nthing to fuss over--it was past considering.\\n\\nThe sun was westering; the Gap began to be in shadow, although the point\\nat which she sat was well above the valley. The girl was all at once\\naware that she was tired and a little timid of what lay before her. She\\nhad written to Shade Buckheath, a neighbour's boy with whom she had gone\\nto school, now employed as a mechanic or loom-fixer in one of the cotton\\nmills, and from whom she had received a reply saying that she could get\\n\\n\\nwork in Cottonville if she would come down.\\n\\nMavity Bence, who had given Johnnie her first clothes, was a weaver in\\nthe Hardwick mill at Cottonville, Watauga's milling suburb; her father,\\nGideon Himes, with whom Shade Buckheath learned his trade, was a skilled\\nmechanic, and had worked as a loom-fixer for a while. At present he was\\nkeeping a boarding-house for the hands, and it was here Johnnie was to\\nfind lodging. Shade himself was reported to be doing extremely well. He\\nhad promised in his letter that if Johnnie came on a Sunday evening he\\nwould walk up the road a piece and meet her. She now began to hope that\\nhe would come. Then, waiting for him, she forgot him, and set herself to\\nimagine what work in the cotton mill and life in town would be like.\\n\\nTo Shade Buckheath, strolling up the road, in the expansiveness of his\\nholiday mood and the dignity of his Sunday suit, the first sight of\\nJohnnie came with a little unwelcome shock. He had left her in the\\nmountains a tall, thin, sandy-haired girl in the growing age. He got his\\nfirst sight of her profile relieved against the green of the wayside\\nbank, with a bunch of blooming azaleas starring its verdure behind her\\nbright head. He was not artist enough to appreciate the picture at its\\nvalue; he simply had the sudden resentful feeling of one who has asked\\nfor a hen and been offered a bird of paradise. She was tall and lithe\\nand strong; her thick, fair hair, without being actually curly, seemed\\nto be so vehemently alive that it rippled a bit in its length, as a\\nswift-flowing brook does over a stone. It rose up around her brow in a\\nroll that was almost the fashionable coiffure. Those among whom she had\\nbeen bred, laconically called the colour red; but in fact it was only\\ntoo deep a gold to be quite yellow. Johnnie's face, even in repose, was\\nalways potentially joyous. The clear, wide, gray eyes, under their\\narching brows, the mobile lips, held as it were the smile in solution;\\nwhen one addressed her it broke swiftly into being, the pink lips\\nlifting adorably above the white teeth, the long fringed eyes crinkling\\ndeliciously about the corners. Johnnie loved to laugh, and the heart of\\nany reasonable being was instantly moved to give her cause.\\n\\nFor himself, the young man was a prevalent type among his people. Brown,\\nwell built, light on his feet, with heavy black hair growing low on his\\nforehead, and long blackish-gray eyes, there was something Latin in the\\n\\n\\ngrace of his movements and in his glance. Life ran strong in Shade\\nBuckheath. He stepped with an independent stride that was almost a\\nswagger, and already felt himself a successful man; but that one of the\\ntribe of borrowing Passmores should presume to such opulence of charm\\nstruck him as well-nigh impudent. The pure outlines of Johnnie's\\nfeatures, their aristocratic mould, the ruddy gold of her rich,\\nclustering hair, those were things it seemed to him a good mill-hand\\nmight well have dispensed with. Then the girl turned, saw him, and\\nflashed him a swift smile of greeting.\\n\\n\\\"It's mighty kind of you to come up and meet me,\\\" she said, getting to\\nher feet a little awkwardly on account of the shoes, and picking up\\nher bundle.\\n\\n\\\"I 'lowed you might get lost,\\\" bantered the young fellow, not offering\\nto carry the packet as they trudged away side by side. \\\"How's everybody\\nback on Unaka? Has your Uncle Pros found his silver mine yet?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" returned Johnnie seriously, \\\"but he's lookin' for it.\\\"\\n\\nShade threw back his head and laughed so long and loud that it would\\nhave been embarrassing to any one less sound and sweet-natured than\\nthis girl.\\n\\n\\\"I reckon he is,\\\" said Buckheath. \\\"I reckon Pros Passmore will be\\nlookin' for that silver mine when Gabriel blows. It runs in the family,\\ndon't it?\\\"\\n\\nJohnnie looked at him and shook her head.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"You've been learnin' town ways, haven't you?\\\" she asked simply.\\n\\n\\\"You mean my makin' game of the Passmores?\\\" he inquired coolly. \\\"No, I\\nnever learned that in the settlement; I learned it in the mountains. I\\njust forgot your name was Passmore, that's all,\\\" he added sarcastically.\\n\\\"Are you goin' to get mad about it?\\\"\\n\\nJohnnie had put on her slat sunbonnet and pulled it down so he could not\\nsee her face.\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" she returned evenly, \\\"I'm not goin' to get mad at anything. And my\\nname's not Passmore, either. My name is Consadine, and I aim to be\\ncalled that. Uncle Pros Passmore is my mother's uncle, and one of the\\nbest men that ever lived, I reckon. If all the folks he's nursed in\\nsickness or laid out in death was numbered over it would be a-many a\\none; and I never heard him take any credit to himself for anything he\\ndid. Why, Shade, the last three years of your father's life Uncle Pros\\ndidn't dare hunt his silver mine much, because your father was paralysed\\nand had to have close waitin' on, and--and there wasn't nobody but Uncle\\nPros, since all his boys was gone and--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, say it. Speak out,\\\" urged Shade hardily. \\\"You mean that all us\\nchaps had cut out and left the old man, and there wasn't a cent of money\\nto pay anybody, and no one but Pros Passmore would 'a' been fool enough\\nto do such hard work without pay. Well, I reckon you're about right. You\\nand me come of a mighty poor nation of folks; but I'm goin' to make my\\npile and have my share, if lookin' out for number one'll do it.\\\"\\n\\nJohnnie turned and regarded him curiously. It was characteristic of the\\nmountain girl, and of her people, that she had not on first meeting\\nstared, village fashion, at his brave attire; and she seemed now\\nconcerned only with the man himself.\\n\\n\\\"I reckon you'll get it,\\\" she said meditatively. \\\"I reckon you will.\\nSometimes I think we always get just what we deserve in this here world,\\nand that the only safe way is to try to deserve something good. I hope I\\ndidn't say too much for Uncle Pros; but he's so easy and say-nothin'\\nhimself, that I just couldn't bear to hear you laughin' at him and not\\nanswer you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I declare, you're plenty funny!\\\" Buckheath burst put boisterously. \\\"No,\\nI ain't mad at you. I kind o' like you for stickin' up for the old man.\\nYou and me'll get along, I reckon.\\\"\\n\\nAs they moved forward, the man and the girl fell into more general chat,\\nthe feeling of irritation at Johnnie's beauty, her superior air, growing\\nrather than diminishing in the young fellow's mind. How dare Pros\\nPassmore's grandniece carry a bright head so high, and flash such\\nglances of liquid fire at her questioner? Shade looked sidewise\\nsometimes at his companion as he asked the news of their mutual friends,\\nand she answered. Yet when he got, along with her mild responses, one of\\nthose glances, he was himself strangely subdued by it, and fain to prop\\nhis leaning prejudices by contrasting her scant print gown, her slat\\n\",\n",
      "            \"sunbonnet, and cowhide shoes with the apparel of the humblest in the\\nvillage which they were approaching.\\n\\nA PEAK IN DARIEN\\n\\nSo walking, and so desultorily talking, they came out on a noble white\\nhighway that wound for miles along the bluffy edge of the upland\\noverlooking the valley upon the one side, fronted by handsome residences\\non the other.\\n\\nIt was Johnnie's first view of a big valley, a river, or a city. She had\\nseen the shoestring creek bottoms between the endless mountains among\\nwhich she was born and bred, the high-hung, cup-like depressions of\\ntheir inner fastnesses; she was used to the cool, clear, boulder-checked\\nmountain creeks that fight their way down those steeps like an armed man\\nbeating off assailants at every turn; she had been taken a number of\\ntimes to Bledsoe, the tiny settlement at the foot of Unaka Old Bald,\\nwhere there were two stores, a blacksmith shop, the post-office and\\nthe church.\\n\\nBelow her, now beginning to glow in the evening light, opened out one of\\nthe finest valleys of the southern Appalachees. Lapped in it, far off,\\nshrouded with rosy mist which she did not identify as transmuted coal\\nsmoke, a city lay, fretted with spires, already sparkling with electric\\nlights, set like a glittering boss of jewels in the broad curve of a\\nshining river.\\n\\nDirectly down the steep at their feet was the cotton-mill town, a suburb\\nclustered about a half-dozen great factories, whose long rows of lighted\\nwindows defined their black bulk. There was a stream here, too; a small,\\nsluggish thing that flowed from tank to tank among the factories,\\nspanned by numerous handrails, bridged in one place for the wagon-road\\nto cross. Mills, valley, town, distant rimming mountains, river and\\ncreek, glowed and pulsed, dissolved and relimned themselves in the\\nuprolling glory of sunset.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, wait for me a minute, Shade,\\\" pleaded the girl, pulling off her\\nsunbonnet.... \\\"I want to look.... Never in my life did I see anything\\nso sightly!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Good land!\\\" laughed the man, with a note of impatience in his voice.\\n\\\"You and me was raised on mountain scenery, as a body may say. I should\\nthink we'd both had enough of it to last us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But this--this is different,\\\" groped Johnnie, trying to explain the\\nemotions that possessed her. \\\"Look at that big settlement over yon. I\\nreckon it's a city. It must be Watauga. It looks like the--the mansions\\nof the blest, in the big Bible that preacher Drane has, down\\nat Bledsoe.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I reckon they're blest--they got plenty of money,\\\" returned Shade, with\\nthe cheap cynicism of his kind.\\n\\n\\\"So many houses!\\\" the girl communed with herself. \\\"There's bound to be\\na-many a person in all them houses,\\\" she went on. One could read the\\nloving outreach to all humanity in her tones.\\n\\n\\\"There is,\\\" put in Shade caustically. \\\"There's many a rogue. You want to\\nlook out for them tricky town folks--a girl like you.\\\"\\n\\nHad he been more kind, he would have said, \\\"a pretty girl like you.\\\" But\\n\\n\\nJohnnie did not miss it; she was used to such as he gave, or less.\\n\\n\\\"Come on,\\\" he urged impatiently. \\\"We won't get no supper if you don't\\nhurry.\\\"\\n\\nSupper! Johnnie drew in her breath and shook her head. With that scene\\nunrolled there, as though all the kingdoms of earth were spread before\\nthem to look upon, she was asked to remember supper! Sighing, but\\nsubmissively, she moved to follow her guide, a reluctant glance across\\nher shoulder, when there came a cry something like that which the wild\\ngeese make when they come over in the spring; and a thing with two\\nshining, fiery eyes, a thing that purred like a giant cat, rounded a\\ncurve in the road and came to a sudden jolting halt beside them.\\n\\nShade stopped immediately for that. Johnnie did not fail to recognize\\nthe vehicle. Illustrated magazines go everywhere in these days. In the\\nautomobile rode a man, bare-headed, dressed in a suit of white flannels,\\nstrange to Johnnie's eyes. Beside him sat a woman in a long, shimmering,\\nsilken cloak, a great, misty, silver-gray veil twined round head and hat\\nand tied in a big bow under the chin. Johnnie had as yet seen nothing\\nmore pretentious than the starched and ruffled flummeries of a small\\nmountain watering-place. This beautiful, peculiar looking garb had\\nsomething of the picturesque, the poetic, about it, that appealed to her\\nas the frocks worn at Chalybeate Springs or Bledsoe had never done. She\\nhad not wanted them. She wanted this. The automobile was stopped, the\\nyoung fellow in it calling to Shade:\\n\\n\\\"I wonder if you could help me with this thing, Buckheath? It's on a\\nstrike again. Show me what you did to it last time.\\\"\\n\\nAlong the edge of the road at this point, for safety's sake, a low stone\\nwall had been laid. Setting down her bundle, Johnnie leaned upon this,\\nand shared her admiration between the valley below and these beautiful,\\ninteresting newcomers. Her bonnet was pushed far back; the wind ruffled\\nthe bright hair about her forehead; the wonder and glory and delight of\\nit all made her deep eyes shine with a child's curiosity and avid\\nwishfulness. Her lips were parted in unconscious smiles. White and red,\\ntremulous, on tiptoe, the eager soul looking out of her face, she was\\nvery beautiful. The man in the automobile observed her kindly; the\\nwoman's features she could not quite see, though the veil was parted.\\n\\nNeither Johnnie nor the driver of the car saw the quick, resentful\\n\\n\\nglance her companion shot at the city man as Shade noted the latter's\\nadmiring look at the girl. Buckheath displayed an awesome familiarity\\nwith the machine and its workings, crawling under the body, and tapping\\nit here and there with a wrench its driver supplied. They backed it and\\nmoved it a little, and seemed to be debating the short turn which would\\ntake them into the driveway leading up to a house on the slope above\\nthe road.\\n\\nJohnnie continued to watch with fascinated eyes; Shade was on his feet\\nnow, reaching into the bowels of the machine to do mysterious things.\\n\\n\\\"It's a broken connection,\\\" he announced briefly.\\n\\n\\\"Is the wire too short to twist together?\\\" inquired the man in the car.\\n\\\"Will you have to put in a new piece?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Uh-huh,\\\" assented Buckheath.\\n\\n\\\"There's a wire in that box there,\\\" directed the other.\\n\\nShade worked in silence for a moment.\\n\\n\\\"Now she'll go, I reckon,\\\" he announced, and once more the driver\\nstarted up his car. It curved perilously near the bundle she had set\\ndown, with the handkerchief containing her cherished blossom lying atop;\\nthe mud-guard swept this latter off, and Buckheath set a foot upon it as\\nhe followed the machine in its progress.\\n\\n\\\"Take care--that was a flower,\\\" the man in the auto warned, too late.\\n\\nShade answered with a quick, backward-flung glance and a little derisive\\nlaugh, but no words. The young fellow stopped the machine, jumped down,\\nand picked up the coarse little handkerchief which showed a bit of\\ndrooping green stem at one end and a glimpse of pink at the other.\\n\\n\\\"I'm sorry,\\\" he said, presenting it to Johnnie with exactly the air and\\ntone he had used in speaking to the lady who was with him in the car.\\n\\\"If I had seen it in time, I might have saved it. I hope it's not\\nmuch hurt.\\\"\\n\\nBuckheath addressed himself savagely to his work at the machine. The\\nwoman in the auto glanced uneasily up at the house on the slope above\\nthem. Johnnie looked into the eyes bent so kindly upon her, and could\\nhave worshipped the ground on which their owner trod. Kindness always\\nmelted her heart utterly, but kindness with such beautiful courtesy\\nadded--this was the quality in flower.\\n\\n\\\"It doesn't make any differ,\\\" she said softly, turning to him a rapt,\\ntransfigured face. \\\"It's just a bloom I brought from the mountains--they\\ndon't grow in the valley, and I found this one on my way down.\\\"\\n\\nThe man wondered a little if it were only the glow of the sunset that\\n\\n\\nlit her face with such shining beauty; he noted how the fires of it\\nflowed over her bright, blown hair and kindled its colour, how it\\nlingered in the clear eyes, and flamed upon the white neck and throat\\ntill they had almost the translucence of pearl.\\n\\n\\\"I think this thing'll work now--for a spell, anyhow,\\\" Shade Buckheath's\\nvoice sounded sharply from the road behind them.\\n\\n\\\"Are you afraid to attempt it, Miss Sessions?\\\" the young man called to\\nhis companion. \\\"If you are, we'll walk up, I'll telephone at the house\\nfor a trap and we'll drive back:--Buckheath will take the machine in\\nfor us.\\\"\\n\\nThe voice was even and low-toned, yet every word came to Johnnie\\ndistinctly. She watched with a sort of rapture the movements of this\\nparty. The man's hair was dark and crisp, and worn a little long about\\nthe temples and ears; he had pleasant dark eyes and an air of being\\nslightly amused, even when he did not smile. The lady apparently said\\nthat she was not afraid, for her companion got in, the machine\\nnegotiated the turn safely and began to move slowly up the steep ascent.\\nAs it did so, the driver gave another glance toward where the mountain\\ngirl stood, a swift, kind glance, and a smile that stayed with her after\\nthe shining car had disappeared in the direction of the wide-porched\\nbuilding where people were laughing and calling to each other and moving\\nabout--people dressed in beautiful garments which Johnnie would fain\\nhave inspected more closely.\\n\\nBuckheath stood gazing at her sarcastically.\\n\\n\\\"Come on,\\\" he ordered, as she held back, lingering. \\\"They ain't no good\\nin you hangin' 'round here. That was Mr. Gray Stoddard, and the lady\\nhe's beauin' is Miss Lydia Sessions, Mr. Hardwick's sister-in-law. He's\\nfor such as her--not for you. He's the boss of the bosses down at\\nCottonville. No use of you lookin' at him.\\\"\\n\\nJohnnie scarcely heard the words. Her eyes were on the wide porch of the\\nhouse above them.\\n\\n\\\"What is that place?\\\" she inquired in an awestruck whisper, as she fell\\ninto step submissively, plodding with bent head at his shoulder.\\n\\n\\\"The Country Club,\\\" Shade flung back at her. \\\"Did you 'low it was\\nheaven?\\\"\\n\\nHeaven! Johnnie brooded on that for a long time. She turned her head\\nstealthily for a last glimpse of the portico where a laughing girl\\ntossed a ball to a young fellow on the terrace below. After all, heaven\\n\\n\\nwas not so far amiss. She had rather associated it with the abode of the\\nblest. The people in it were happy; they moved in beautiful raiment all\\nday long; they spoke to each other kindly. It was love's home, she was\\nsure of that. Then her mind went back to the dress of the girl in\\nthe auto.\\n\\n\\\"I'm a-going to have me a frock like that before I die,\\\" she said, half\\nunconsciously, yet with a sudden passion of resolution. \\\"Yes, if I live\\nI'm a-goin' to have me just such a frock.\\\"\\n\\nShade wheeled in his tracks with a swift narrowing of the slate-gray\\neyes. He had been more stirred than he was willing to acknowledge by the\\ngirl's beauty, and by a nameless power that went out from the seemingly\\nhelpless creature and laid hold of those with whom she came in contact.\\nIt was the open admiration of young Stoddard which had roused the sullen\\nresentment he was now spending on her.\\n\\n\\\"Ye air, air ye?\\\" he demanded sharply. \\\"You're a-goin' to have a frock\\nlike that? And what man's a-goin' to pay for it, I'd like to know?\\\"\\n\\nSuch talk belonged to the valley and the settlement. In the mountains a\\nwoman works, of course, and earns her board and keep. She is a valuable\\nindustrial possession or chattel to the man, who may profit by her\\nlabour; never a luxury--a bill of expense. As she walked, Johnnie nodded\\ntoward the factory in the valley, beginning to blaze with light--her\\nbridge of toil, that was to carry her from the island of Nowhere to the\\ngreat mainland of Life, where everything might be had for the working,\\nthe striving.\\n\\n\\\"I didn't name no man,\\\" she said mildly. \\\"I don't reckon anybody's goin'\\nto give me things. Ain't there the factory where a body may work and\\nearn money for all they need?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I reckon they might, if they was good and careful to need\\npowerful little,\\\" allowed Shade.\\n\\nAt the moment they came to the opening of a small path which plunged\\nabruptly down the steep side of the ridge, curving in and out with--and\\nsometimes across--a carriage road. As they took the first steps on this\\nthe sun forsook the valley at last, and lingered only on the mountain\\ntop where was that Palace of Pleasure into which He and She had\\nvanished, before which the strange chariot waited. And all at once the\\nlittle brook that wound, a golden thread, between the bulk of the mills,\\n\\n\\nflowed, a stream of ink, from pool to pool of black water. The way down\\nturned and turned; and each time that Shade and Johnnie got another\\nsight of the buildings of the little village below, they had changed in\\ncharacter with the changing point of view. They loomed taller, they\\nlooked darker in spite of the pulsing light from their many windows.\\n\\nAnd now there burst out a roar of whistles, like the bellowing of great\\nmonsters. Somehow it struck cold upon the girl's heart. They were coming\\ndown from that wonderful highland where she had seemed to see all the\\nkingdoms of earth spread before her, hers for the conquering; they were\\ndescending into the shadow.\\n\\nAs they came quite to the foot they saw groups of women and children,\\nwith here and there a decrepit man, leaving the cottages and making\\ntheir way toward the lighted mills. From the doors of little shanties\\ntired-faced women with boys and girls walking near them, and, in one or\\ntwo cases, very small ones clinging to their skirts and hands,\\nreinforced the crowd which set in a steady stream toward the bridges and\\nthe open gates in the high board fences.\\n\\n\\\"What are they a-goin' to the factory for on Sunday evening?\\\" Johnnie\\ninquired.\\n\\n\\\"Night turn,\\\" replied Buckheath briefly. \\\"Sunday's over at sundown.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes,\\\" agreed Johnnie dutifully, but rather disheartened. \\\"Trade\\nmust be mighty good if they have to work all night.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Them that works don't get any more for it,\\\" retorted Shade harshly.\\n\\n\\\"What's the little ones goin' to the mill for?\\\" Johnnie questioned,\\nstaring up at him with apprehensive eyes.\\n\\n\\\"Why, to play, I reckon,\\\" returned the young fellow ironically. \\\"Folks\\nmostly does go to the mill to play, don't they?\\\"\\n\\nThe girl ran forward and clasped his arm with eager fingers that shook.\\n\\\"Shade!\\\" she cried; \\\"they can't work those little babies. That one over\\nthere ain't to exceed four year old, and I know it.\\\"\\n\\nThe man looked indifferently to where a tiny boy trotted at his mother's\\nheels, solemn, old-faced, unchildish. He laughed a little.\\n\\n\\\"That thar chap is the oldest feller in the mills,\\\" he said. \\\"That's\\nBenny Tarbox. He's too short to tend a frame, but his maw lets him help\\nher at the loom--every weaver has obliged to have helpers wait on 'em.\\nYou'll get used to it.\\\"\\n\\nGet used to it! She pulled the sunbonnet about her face. The gold was\\nall gone from the earth, and from her mood as well. She raised her eyes\\nto where the last brightness lingered on the mountain-top. Up there they\\nwere happy. And even as her feet carried her forward to Pap Himes's\\nboarding-house, her soul went clamouring, questing back toward the\\nheights, and the sunlight, the love and laughter, she had left behind.\\n\\n\\\"The power and the glory--the power and the glory,\\\" she whispered over\\nand over to herself. \\\"Is it all back there?\\\" Again she looked wistfully\\ntoward the heights. \\\"But maybe a body with two feet can climb.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nOF THE USE OF FEET\\n\\nThe suburb of Cottonville bordered a creek, a starveling, wet-weather\\nstream which offered the sole suggestion of sewerage. The village was\\ncut in two by this natural division. It clung to the shelving sides of\\nthe shallow ravine; it was scattered like bits of refuse on the numerous\\nrailroad embankments, where building was unhandy and streets almost\\nimpossible, to be convenient to the mills. Six big factories in all,\\nsome on one side of the state line and some on the other, daily breathed\\nin their live current of operatives and exhaled them again to fill the\\nlitter of flimsy shanties.\\n\\nThe road which wound down from the heights ran through the middle of the\\nvillage and formed its main street. Across the ravine from it, reached\\nby a wooden bridge, stood a pretentious frame edifice, a boarding-house\\nbuilt by the Gloriana mill for the use of its office force and\\nmechanics. Men were lounging on the wide porches of this structure in\\nSabbath-afternoon leisure, smoking and singing. The young Southern male\\nof any class is usually melodious. Across the hollow came the sounds of\\na guitar and a harmonica.\\n\\n\\\"Listen a minute, Shade. Ain't that pretty? I know that tune,\\\" said\\nJohnnie, and she began to hum softly under her breath, her girlish heart\\nresponding to the call.\\n\\n\\\"Hush,\\\" admonished Buckheath harshly. \\\"You don't want to be runnin'\\nafter them fellers. It's some of the loom-fixers.\\\"\\n\\nIn silence he led the way past the great mill buildings of red brick,\\nsquare and unlovely but many-windowed and glowing, alight, throbbing\\nwith the hum of pent industry. Johnnie gazed steadily up at those\\nwindows; the glow within was other than that which gilded turret and\\npinnacle and fairy isle in the Western sky, yet perchance this light\\nmight be a lamp to the feet of one who wished to climb that way. Her\\nadventurous spirit rose to the challenge, and she said softly, more to\\nherself than to the man:\\n\\n\\\"I'm a-goin' to be a boss hand in there. I'm goin' to get the highest\\nwages of any girl in the mill, time I learn my trade, because I'm goin'\\nto try harder 'n anybody.\\\"\\n\\nShade looked around at her, curiously. Her beauty, her air of\\nsuperiority, still repelled him--such fancy articles were not apt to be\\nof much use--but this sounded like a woman who might be valuable to\\nher master.\\n\\n\\n\\nJohnnie returned his gaze with the frank good will of a child, and\\nsuddenly he forgot everything but the adorable lift of her pink lip over\\nthe shining white teeth.\\n\\nThe young fellow now halted at the step of a big frame house. The\\noutside was of an extent to seem fairly pretentious; yet so mean was the\\nconstruction, so sparing of window and finish, that the building showed\\nitself instantly for what it was--the cheap boarding-house of a mill\\ntown. A group of tired-looking girls sitting on the step in blessed\\nSunday idleness and cheap Sunday finery stared as he and Johnnie\\nascended and crossed the porch. One of these, a tall lank woman of\\nperhaps thirty years, got up and followed a few hesitating paces,\\napparently more as a matter of curiosity than with any hospitable\\nintent.\\n\\nA man with a round red face and a bald pate whose curly fringe of\\ngrizzled, reddish hair made him look like a clown in a pantomime,\\nmotioned them with a surly thumb toward the back of the house, where\\nclattering preparations for supper were audible and odoriferous. The old\\nfellow sat in a splint-bottomed chair of extra size and with arms. This\\nhe had kicked back against the wall of the house, so that his short legs\\ndid not reach the floor, the big carpet-slippered feet finding rest on\\nthe rung of the chair. His attitude was one of relaxation. The face,\\nbroad, flat, small of eye and wide of mouth, did indeed suggest the\\nclown countenance; yet there was in it, and in the whole personality,\\nsomething of the Eastern idol, the journeyman attempt of crude humanity\\nto represent power. And the potential cruelty of the type slept in his\\nplacid countenance as surely as ever in the dreaming face of Shiva, the\\ndestroyer.\\n\\n\\\"Mrs. Bence--Aunt Mavity,\\\" called Shade, advancing into the narrow hall.\\nIn answer a tired-faced woman came from the kitchen, wiping her hands on\\nher checked apron.\\n\\n\\\"Good Lord, if it ain't Johnnie! I was 'feared she Wouldn't git here\\nto-night,\\\" she ejaculated when she saw the girl. \\\"Take her out on the\\nporch, Shade; I ain't got a minute now. Pap's poorly again, and I'm\\nobliged to put the late supper on the table for them thar gals--the\\nnight shift's done eat and gone. I'll show her whar she's to sleep at,\\nafter while. I don't just rightly know whar Pap aimed to have her stay,\\\"\\nshe concluded hastily, as something boiled over on the stove. Johnnie\\n\\n\\nset her bundle down in the corner of the kitchen.\\n\\n\\\"I'll help,\\\" she said simply, as she drew the excited coffee-pot to a\\ncorner of the range and dosed it judiciously with cold water.\\n\\n\\\"Well, now, that's mighty good of you,\\\" panted worried Mavity Bence.\\n\\\"How queer things comes 'round,\\\" she ruminated as they dished up the\\nbiscuits and fried pork. \\\"I helped you into the very world, Johnnie. I\\nlived neighbour to your maw, and they wasn't nobody else to be with her\\nwhen you was born, and I went over. I never suspicioned that you would\\nbe helpin' me git supper down here in the settlement inside o'\\ntwenty year.\\\"\\n\\nJohnnie ran and fetched and carried, as though she had never done\\nanything else in her life, intent on the one task. She was alive in\\nevery fibre of her young body; she saw, she heard, as these words cannot\\nalways be truthfully applied to people.\\n\\n\\\"Did Shade tell you anything about Louvania?\\\" inquired the woman at\\nlength.\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" replied Johnnie softly, \\\"but I seen it in the paper.\\\"\\n\\nLouvania Bence, the only remaining child of the widow, had, two weeks\\nbefore, left her work at the mill, taken the trolley in to Watauga,\\nwalked out upon the county bridge across the Tennessee and jumped off.\\nJohnnie had read the published account, passed from hand to hand in the\\nmountains where Pap Himes and Mavity Bence had troops of kin and where\\nLouvania was born. The statement ran that there was no love affair, and\\nthat the girl's distaste for her work at the cotton mill must have been\\nthe reason for the suicide.\\n\\n\\\"That there talk in the newspaper wasn't right,\\\" Louvania's mother\\nchoked. \\\"They wasn't a word of truth in it. You know in reason that if\\nLouvany hated to work in the mill as bad as all that she'd have named it\\nto me--her own mother--and she never did. She never spoke a word like\\nit, only to say now and ag'in, as we all do, that it was hard, and that\\nshe'd--well, she did 'low she'd ruther be dead, as gals will; but she\\ncouldn't have meant it. Do you think she could have meant it, Johnnie?\\\"\\n\\nThe faded eyes, clouded now by tears, stared up into Johnnie's clear\\nyoung orbs.\\n\\n\\\"Of course she couldn't have meant it,\\\" Johnnie comforted her. \\\"Why, I'm\\nsure it's fine to work in the mill. If she didn't feel so, she'd have\\n\\n\\ntold you the thing. She must have been out of her mind. People always\\nare when they--do that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's what I keep a-thinkin',\\\" the poor mother said, clinging\\npathetically to that which gave her consolation and cheer. \\\"I say to\\nmyself that it must have been some brain disease took her all of a\\nsudden and made her crazy that-a-way; because God knows she had nothing\\nto fret her nor drive her to such.\\\"\\n\\nBy this time the meal was on the table, and the girls trooped in from\\nthe porch. The old man with the bald pate was seating himself at the\\nhead of the board, and Johnnie asked the privilege of helping wait\\non table.\\n\\n\\\"No, you ain't a-goin' to,\\\" Mrs. Bence said hospitably, pushing her into\\na seat. \\\"If you start in to work in the morning, like I reckon you will,\\nyou ain't got no other time to get acquainted with the gals but right\\nnow. You set down. We don't take much waitin' on. We all pass things,\\nand reach for what we want.\\\"\\n\\nIn the smoky illumination of the two ill-cleaned lamps which stood one\\nat each end of the table, Johnnie's fair face shone out like a star. The\\ntall woman who had shown a faint interest in them on the porch was\\nseated just opposite. Her bulging light-blue eyes scarcely left the\\nnewcomer's countenance as she absent-mindedly filled her mouth. She was\\na scant, stringy-looking creature, despite her height; the narrow back\\nwas hooped like that of an old woman and the shoulders indrawn, so that\\nthe chest was cramped, and sent forth a wheezy, flatted voice that\\nsorted ill with her inches; her round eyes had no speculation in them;\\nher short chin was obstinate without power; the thin, half-gray hair\\nthat wanted to curl feebly about her lined forehead was stripped away\\nand twisted in a knot no bigger than a walnut, at the back of a\\nbent head.\\n\\nFor some time the old man at the end of the table stowed himself\\nmethodically with victuals; his air was that of a man packing a box;\\nthen he brought his implements to half-rest, as it were, and gave a\\ndivided attention to the new boarder.\\n\\n\\\"What did I hear them call yo' name?\\\" he inquired gruffly.\\n\\nJohnnie repeated her title and gave him one of those smiles that went\\nwith most of her speeches. It seemed to suggest things to the\\nold sinner.\\n\\n\\\"Huh,\\\" he grunted; \\\"I riccollect ye now. Yo' pap was a Consadine, but\\n\\n\\nyou're old Virgil Passmore's grandchild. One of the borryin' Passmores,\\\"\\nhe added, staring coolly at Johnnie. \\\"Virge was a fine, upstandin' old\\nman. You've got the favour of him--if you wasn't a gal.\\\"\\n\\nHe evidently shared Schopenhauer's distaste for \\\"the low-statured,\\nwide-hipped, narrow-shouldered sex.\\\"\\n\\nThe girls about the table were all listening eagerly. Johnnie had the\\nsensation of a freshman who has walked out on the campus too\\nwell dressed.\\n\\n\\\"Virge was a great beau in his day,\\\" continued Pap, reminiscently. \\\"He\\nliked to wear good clothes, too. I mind how he borried Abner Wimberly's\\nweddin' coat and wore it something like ten year--showed it off fine--it\\nfitted him enough sight better than it ever fitted little old Ab. Then\\nhe comes back to Wimberly at the end of so long a time with the buttons.\\nHe says, says he, 'Looks like that thar cloth yo' coat was made of\\nwasn't much 'count, Ab,' says he. 'I think Jeeters cheated ye on it. But\\nthe buttons was good. The buttons wore well. And them I'm bringin' back,\\n'caze you may have use for 'em, and I have none, now the coat's gone.\\nAlso, what I borry I return, as everybody knows.' That was your\\ngranddaddy.\\\"\\n\\nThere was a tremendous giggling about the board as the old man made an\\nend. Johnnie herself smiled, though her face was scarlet. She had no\\nwords to tell her tormentor that the borrowing trait in her tribe which\\nhad earned them the name of the borrowing Passmores proceeded not from\\navarice, which ate into Pap Himes's very marrow, but from its reverse\\ntrait of generosity. She knew vaguely that they would have shared with a\\nneighbour their last bite or dollar, and had thus never any doubt of\\nbeing shared with nor any shame in the asking.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" pursued Himes, surveying Johnnie chucklingly, \\\"I mind when you\\nwas born. Has your Uncle Pros found his silver mine yet?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My mother has often told me how good you and Mrs. Bence was to us when\\nI was little,\\\" answered Johnnie mildly. \\\"No, sir, Uncle Pros hasn't\\nfound his silver mine yet--but he's still a-hunting for it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe reply appeared to delight Himes. He laughed immoderately, even as\\nBuckheath had done.\\n\\n\\\"I'll bet he is,\\\" he agreed. \\\"Pros Passmore's goin' to hunt that there\\nsilver mine till he finds another hole in the ground about six feet long\\nand six feet deep--that's what he's a-goin' to do.\\\"\\n\\nThe hasty supper was well under way now. Mrs. Bence brought the last of\\nthe hot bread, and shuffled into a seat. The old man at the head of the\\nboard returned to his feeding, but with somewhat moderated voracity. At\\nlength, pretty fully gorged, he raised his head from over his plate and\\nlooked about him for diversion. Again his attention was directed to\\nthe new girl.\\n\\n\\\"Air ye wedded?\\\" he challenged suddenly.\\n\\nShe shook her head and laughed.\\n\\n\\\"Got your paigs sot for to git any one?\\\" he followed up his\\ninvestigations.\\n\\nJohnnie laughed more than ever, and blushed again.\\n\\n\\\"How old air ye?\\\" demanded her inquisitor. \\\"Eighteen? 'Most nineteen?\\nGood Lord! You're a old maid right now. Well, don't you let twenty go by\\nwithout gittin' your hooks on a man. My experience is that when a gal\\ngits to be twenty an' ain't wedded--or got her paigs sot for to\\nwed--she's left. Left,\\\" he concluded impressively.\\n\\nThat quick smile of Johnnie's responded.\\n\\n\\\"I reckon I'll do my best,\\\" she agreed reasonably; \\\"but some folks can\\n\\n\\ndo that and miss it.\\\"\\n\\nHimes nodded till he set the little red curls all bobbing around the\\nbare spot.\\n\\n\\\"Uh-huh,\\\" he approved, \\\"I reckon that's so. Women is plenty, and men\\nhard to git. Here's Mandy Meacham, been puttin' in her best licks for\\nthirty year or more, an' won't never make it.\\\"\\n\\nJohnnie did not need to be told which one was Mandy. The sallow cheek of\\nthe tall woman across from her reddened; the short chin wabbled a bit\\nmore than the mastication of the biscuit in hand demanded; a moisture\\nappeared in the inexpressive blue eyes; but she managed a shaky laugh to\\nassist the chorus which always followed Pap Himes's little jokes.\\n\\nThe old man held a sort of state among these poor girls, and took\\ntribute of admiration, as he had taken tribute of life and happiness\\nfrom daughter and granddaughter. Gideon Himes was not actively a bad\\nman; he was as without personal malice as malaria. When it makes\\nmiserable those about it, or robs a girl of her pink cheeks, her bright\\neyes, her joy of life, wearing the elasticity out of her step and making\\nan old woman of her before her time, we do not fly into a rage at it--we\\navoid it. The Pap Himeses of this world are to be avoided if possible.\\n\\nMandy stared at her plate in mortified silence. Johnnie wished she could\\nthink of something pleasant to say to the poor thing, when her attention\\nwas diverted by the old man once more addressing herself.\\n\\n\\\"You look stout and hearty; if you learn to weave as fast as you ort,\\nand git so you can tend five or six looms, I'll bet you git a husband,\\\"\\nhe remarked in a burst of generosity. \\\"I'll bet you do; and what's more,\\nI'll speak a good word for ye. A gal that's a peart weaver's mighty apt\\nto find a man. You learn your looms if you want to git wedded--and I\\nknow in reason you do--it's about all gals of your age thinks of.\\\"\\n\\nWhen supper was over Johnnie was a little surprised to see the tall\\nwoman approach Pap Himes like a small child begging a favour of a harsh\\ntaskmaster.\\n\\n\\\"Can't that there new girl bunk with me?\\\" she inquired earnestly.\\n\\n\\\"I had the intention to give her Louvany's bed,\\\" Pap returned promptly.\\n\\\"As long as nobody's with you, I reckon I don't care; but if one comes\\nin, you take 'em, and she goes with Mavity, mind. I cain't waste room,\\npoor as I am.\\\"\\n\\nPiloted by the tall girl, Johnnie climbed the narrow stair to a long\\nbare room where a row of double beds accommodated eight girls. The couch\\nshe was to occupy had been slept in during the day by a mill hand who\\n\",\n",
      "            \"was on night turn, and it had not been remade. Deftly Johnnie\\nstraightened and spread it, while her partner grumbled.\\n\\n\\\"What's the use o' doin' that?\\\" Mandy inquired, stretching herself and\\nyawning portentously. \\\"We'll jist muss it all up in about two minutes.\\nWhen you've worked in a mill as long as I have you'll git over the\\nnotion of makin' your bed, for hit's _but_ a notion.\\\"\\n\\nJohnnie laughed across her shoulder.\\n\\n\\\"I'd just as soon do it,\\\" she reassured her companion. \\\"I do love smooth\\nbedclothes; looks like I dream better on 'em and under 'em.\\\"\\n\\nMandy sat down on the edge of the bed, interfering considerably with the\\nfinal touches Johnnie was putting to it.\\n\\n\\\"You're a right good gal,\\\" she opined patronizingly, \\\"but foolish. The\\nnew ones always is foolish. I can put you up to a-many a thing that'll\\nhelp you along, though, and I'm willin' to do it.\\\"\\n\\nAgain Johnnie smiled at her, that smile of enveloping sweetness and\\ntenderness. It made something down in the left side of poor Mandy's\\nslovenly dress-bodice vibrate and tingle.\\n\\n\\\"I'll thank you mightily,\\\" said Johnnie Consadine, \\\"mightily.\\\" And knew\\nnot how true a word she spoke.\\n\\n\\\"You see,\\\" counselled Mandy from the bed into which she had rolled with\\nmost of her clothes on, \\\"you want to get in with Miss Lydia Sessions and\\nthe Uplift ladies, and them thar swell folks.\\\"\\n\\nJohnnie nodded, busily at work making a more elaborated night toilet\\nthan the others, who were going to bed all about them, paying little\\nattention to their conversation.\\n\\n\\\"Miss Lyddy she ain't as young as she once was, and the boys has quit\\nhangin' 'round her as much as they used to; so now she has took up with\\ngood works,\\\" the girl on the bed explained with a directness which Miss\\nSessions would not perhaps have appreciated. \\\"Her and some other of the\\nnobby folks has started what they call a Uplift club amongst the mill\\ngirls. Thar's a big room whar you dance--if you can--and whar they give\\nlittle suppers for us with not much to eat; and thar's a place where\\nthey sorter preach to ye--lecture she calls it. I don't know what-all\\nMiss Lyddy hain't got for her club. But you jist go, and listen, and say\\nhow much obliged you are, an she'll do a lot for you, besides payin'\\nyour wages to get you out of the mill any day she wants you for the\\nUpliftin' business.\\\"\\n\\nMandy had a gasp, which occurred between sentences and at the end of\\ncertain words, with grotesque effect. Johnnie was to find that this gasp\\n\\n\\nwas always very much to the fore when Mandy was being uplifted. It then\\nserved variously as the gasp of humility, gratitude, admiration; the\\ngasp of chaste emotion, the gasp of reprobation toward others who did\\nnot come forward to be uplifted.\\n\\n\\\"Did you say there was books at that club?\\\" inquired Johnnie out of the\\ndarkness--she had now extinguished the light. \\\"Can a body learn things\\nfrom the lectures?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Uh-huh,\\\" agreed Mandy sleepily; \\\"but you don't have to read 'em--the\\nbooks. They lend 'em to you, and you take 'em home, and after so long a\\ntime you take 'em back sayin' how much good they done you. That's the\\nway. If Mr. Stoddard's 'round, he'll ask you questions about 'em; but\\nMiss Lyddy won't--she hates to find out that any of her plans\\nain't workin'.\\\"\\n\\nFor a long time there was silence. Mandy was just dropping off into her\\nfirst heavy sleep, when a whispering voice asked,\\n\\n\\\"Is Mr. Stoddard--has he got right brown eyes and right brown hair, and\\ndoes he ride in one of these--one of these--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Good land!\\\" grumbled the addressed, \\\"I thought it was mornin' and I had\\nto git up! You ort to been asleep long ago. Yes, Mr. Stoddard's got\\nsorter brown eyes and hair, and he rides in a otty-mobile. How did\\nyou know?\\\"\\n\\nBut Mandy was too tired to stay awake to marvel over that. Her rhythmic\\nsnores soon proved that she slept, while Johnnie lay thinking of the\\nvarious proffers she had that evening received of a lamp to her feet, a\\nlight on her path. And she would climb--yes, she would climb. Not by the\\nroad Pap Himes pointed out; not by the devious path Mandy Meacham\\nsuggested; but by the rugged road of good, honest toil, to heights where\\nwas the power and the glory, she would certainly strive.\\n\\nShe conned over the new things which this day had brought. Again she saw\\nthe auto swing around the curve and halt; she got the outline of the\\nman's bent head against the evening sky. They were singing again over at\\nthe mechanics' boarding-house; the sound came across to her window; the\\nvibrant wires, the chorus of deep male voices, even the words she knew\\nthey were using but could not distinguish, linked themselves in some\\nfashion with memory of a man's eyes, his smile, his air of tender\\ndeference as he cherished her broken flower. Something caught in her\\n\\n\\nthroat and choked. Her mind veered to the figures on the porch of that\\nPalace of Pleasure; the girl with the ball tossing it to the young\\nfellow below on the lawn. In memory she descended the hill, coming down\\ninto the shadows with each step, looking back to the heights and the\\nlight. Well, she had said that if one had feet one might climb, and\\nto-night the old man had tried to train her to his pace for attaining\\nheart's desire. In the midst of a jumble of autos and shining mill\\nwindows, she watched the room grow ghostly with the light of a\\nlate-risen moon. Suddenly afar off she heard the \\\"honk! honk! honk!\\\"\\nwhich had preceded the advent of the car on the ridge road.\\n\\nGetting up, she stole, to the one window which the long room afforded.\\nIt gave upon the main street of the village. \\\"Honk! honk! honk!\\\" She\\ngazed toward the steep from which the sounds seemed to come. There,\\nflashing in and out of the greenery, appeared half a dozen pairs of\\nfiery eyes. A party of motorists were going in to Watauga, starting from\\nthe Country Club on the Ridge crest. Johnnie watched them, fascinated.\\nAs the foremost car swept down the road and directly beneath her window,\\nits driver, whom she recognized with a little shiver, by the\\ncharacteristic carriage of his head, swerved the machine out and stopped\\nit at the curb below. The others passed, calling gay inquiries to him.\\n\\n\\\"We're all right,\\\" she heard a well-remembered voice reply. \\\"You go\\nahead--we'll be there before you.\\\"\\n\\nThe slim, gray-clad figure in the seat beside him laughed softly and\\nfluttered a white handkerchief as the last car went on.\\n\\n\\\"Now!\\\" exulted the voice. \\\"I'll put on my goggles and cap and we'll show\\nthem what running is.\\n\\n  'It's they'll take the high road and we'll take the low,\\n  And we'll be in Watauga befo-o-ore them!'\\\"\\n\\nEven as he spoke he adjusted his costume, and Johnnie saw the car shoot\\nforward like a living creature eager on the trail. She sighed as she\\nlooked after them.\\n\\nFeet--of what use were feet to follow such a flight as that?\\n\\nTHE MOCCASIN FLOWER\\n\\nJohnnie was used to hardship and early rising, but in an intermittent\\nfashion; for the Passmores and Consadines were a haggard lot that came\\nto no lure but their own pleasure. They might--and often did--go hungry,\\nill-clad, ill-housed; they might sometimes--in order to keep soul and\\n\\n\\nbody together--have to labour desperately at rude tasks unsuited to\\nthem; but these times were exceptions, and between such seasons, down to\\nthe least of the tribe, they had always followed the Vision, pursuing\\nthe flying skirts of whatever ideal was in their shapely heads. The\\nlittle cabin in the gash of the hills owned for domain a rocky ravine\\nthat was the standing jest of the mountain-side.\\n\\n\\\"Sure, hit's good land--fine land,\\\" the mountaineers would comment with\\ntheir inveterate, dry, lazy humour. \\\"Nothing on earth to hender a man\\nfrom raisin' a crap off 'n it--ef he could once git the leathers on a\\ngood stout, willin' pa'r o' hawks or buzzards, an' a plough hitched to\\n'em.\\\" And Johnnie could remember the other children teasing her and\\nsaying that her folks had to load a gun with seed corn and shoot it into\\nthe sky to reach their fields. Yet, the unmended roof covered much joy\\nand good feeling. They were light feet that trod the unsecured\\npuncheons. The Passmores were tender of each other's eccentricities,\\nadmiring of each other's virtues. A wolf race nourished on the knees of\\npurple kings, how should they ever come down to wearing any man's\\ncollar, to slink at heel and retrieve for him?\\n\\nOne would have said that to the daughter of such the close cotton-mill\\nroom with its inhuman clamour, its fetid air, its long hours of\\nenforced, monotonous, mechanical toil, would be prison with the torture\\nadded. But Johnnie looked forward to her present enterprise as a soldier\\ngoing into a new country to conquer it. She was buoyantly certain, and\\ndeterminedly delighted with everything. When, the next morning after her\\narrival, Mandy Meacham shook her by the shoulder and bade her get up,\\nthe room was humming with the roar of mill whistles, and the gray dawn\\nleaking in at its one window in a churlish, chary fashion, reminded her\\nthat they were under the shadow of a mountain instead of living upon\\nits top.\\n\\n\\\"I don't see what in the world could 'a' made me sleep so!\\\" Johnnie\\ndeprecated, as she made haste to dress herself. \\\"Looks like I never had\\nnothing to do yesterday, except walking down. I've been on foot that\\nmuch many a time and never noticed it.\\\"\\n\\nThe other girls in the room, poor souls, were all cross and sleepy.\\nNobody had time to converse with Johnnie. As they went down the stairs\\nanother contingent began to straggle up, having eaten a hasty meal after\\n\\n\\ntheir night's work, and making now for certain of the just-vacated beds.\\n\\nJohnnie ran into the kitchen to help Mrs. Bence get breakfast on the\\ntable, for Pap Himes was bad off this morning with a misery somewhere,\\nand his daughter was sending word to the cotton mill to put a substitute\\non her looms till dinner time. Almost as much to her own surprise as to\\nthat of everybody else, Mandy Meacham proposed to stay and take Johnnie\\nin to register for a job.\\n\\nWhen the others were all seated at table, the new girl from the\\nmountains took her cup of coffee and a biscuit and dropped upon the\\ndoorstep to eat her breakfast. The back yard was unenclosed, a litter of\\ntin cans and ashes running with its desert disorder into a similar one\\non either side. But there were no houses back of the Himes place, the\\nground falling away sharply to the rocky creek bed. Across the ravine\\nhalf a dozen strapping young fellows were lounging, waiting for\\nbreakfast; loom-fixers and mechanics these, whose hours were more\\nfavourable than those of the women and children workers.\\n\\n\\\"It's lots prettier out here than it is in the house,\\\" she returned\\nsmilingly, when Mavity Bence offered to get her a chair. \\\"I do love to\\nbe out-of-doors.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Huh,\\\" grunted Mandy with her mouth full of biscuit, \\\"I reckon a cotton\\nmill'll jest about kill you. What makes you work in one, anyhow? I\\nwouldn't if I could help it.\\\"\\n\\nJohnnie eyed the tall girl gravely. \\\"I've got to earn some money,\\\" she\\nsaid at length. \\\"Ma and the children have to be taken care of. I don't\\nknow of any better way than the mill.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"An' I don't know of any worse,\\\" retorted Mandy sourly, as they went out\\ntogether.\\n\\nJohnnie began to feel timid. There had been a secret hope that she would\\nmeet Shade on the way to the mill, or that Mrs. Bence would finally get\\nthrough in time to accompany her. She was suddenly aware that there was\\nnot a soul within sound of her voice who had belonged to her former\\nworld. With a little gasp she looked about her as they entered\\nthe office.\\n\\nThe Hardwick mill to which they now came consisted of a number of large,\\nred brick buildings, joined by covered passage-ways, abutting on one of\\nthose sullen pools Johnnie had noted the night before, the yard enclosed\\nby a tight board fence, so high that the operatives in the first-and\\nsecond-floor rooms could not see the street. This for the factory\\n\\n\\nportion; the office did not front on the shut-in yard, but opened out\\nfreely on to the street, through a little grassy square of its own,\\ntree-shadowed, with paved walks and flower beds. As with all the mills\\nin its district, the suggestion was dangerously apt of a penitentiary,\\nwith its high wooden barrier, around all the building, the only free\\napproach from the world to its corridors through the seemly, humanized\\noffice, where abided the heads, the bosses, the free men, who came and\\nwent at will. The walls were already beginning to wear that garment of\\ngreen which the American ivy flings over so many factory buildings.\\n\\nAs the two girls came up, Johnnie looked at the wide, clear, plate\\nwindows, the brass railing that guarded the heavy granite approach, the\\nshining name \\\"Hardwick\\\" deep-set in brazen lettering on the step over\\nwhich they entered. Inside, the polished oak and metal of office\\nfittings carried on the idea of splendour, if not of luxury. Back of the\\ncrystal windows were the tempering shades, all was spacious, ordered\\nwith quiet dignity, and there was no sense of hurry in the well-clad,\\nwell-groomed figures of men that sat at the massive desks or moved about\\nthe softly carpeted floors. The corridor was long, but cleanly swept,\\nand, at its upper portion, covered with a material unfamiliar to\\nJohnnie, but which she recognized as suited to its purpose. Down at the\\nfurther end of that corridor, something throbbed and moaned and roared\\nand growled--the factory was awake there and working. The contrast\\nstruck cold to the girl's heart. Here, yet more sharply defined, was the\\nsame difference she had noted between the Palace of Pleasure on the\\nheights and the mills at the foot of the mountain.\\n\\nWould the people think she was good enough? Would they understand how\\nhard she meant to try? For a minute she had a desperate impulse to turn\\nand run. Then she heard Mandy's thin, flatted tones announcing:\\n\\n\\\"This hyer girl wants to git a job in the mill. Miz Bence, she cain't\\ncome down this morning--you'll have to git somebody to tend her looms\\ntill noon; Pap, he's sick, and she has obliged to wait on him--so I\\nbrung the new gal.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All right,\\\" said the man she addressed. \\\"She can wait there; you go on\\nto your looms.\\\"\\n\\nJohnnie sat on the bench against the wall where newcomers applying for\\npositions were placed. The man she was to see had not yet come to his\\ndesk, and she remained unnoticed and apparently forgotten for more than\\n\\n\\nan hour. The offices were entered from the other side, yet a doorway\\nclose by Johnnie commanded a view of a room and desk. To it presently\\ncame one who seated himself and began opening and reading letters.\\nJohnnie caught her breath and leaned a little forward, watching him, her\\nheart in her eyes, hands locked hard together in her lap. It was the\\nyoung man of the car. He was not in white flannels now, but he looked\\nalmost as wonderful to the girl in his gray business suit, with the air\\nof easy command, and the quiet half-smile only latent on his face. Shade\\nBuckheath had spoken of Gray Stoddard as the boss of the bosses down at\\nCottonville. Indeed, his position was unique. Inheritor of large\\nholdings in Eastern cotton-mill stock, he had returned from abroad on\\nthe death of his father, to look into this source of his very ample\\nincome. The mills in which he was concerned were not earning as they\\nshould, so he was told; and there was discussion as to whether they be\\nmoved south, or a Southern mill be established which might be considered\\nin the nature of a branch, and where the coarser grades of sheeting\\nwould be manufactured, as well as all the spinning done.\\n\\nBut Stoddard was not of the blood that takes opinions second-hand. Upon\\nhis mother's side he was the grandson of one of the great anti-slavery\\nagitators. The sister of this man, Gray's great-aunt, had stood beside\\nhim on the platform when there was danger in it; and after the Negro was\\nfreed and enfranchised, she had devoted a long life to the cause of\\nwoman suffrage. The mother who bore him died young. She left him to the\\ncare of a conservative father, but the blood that came through her did\\nnot make for conservatism.\\n\\nPerhaps it was some admixture of his father's traits which set the young\\nman to investigating the cotton-mill situation in his own fashion. To do\\nthis as he conceived it should be done, he had hired himself to the\\nHardwick Spinning Company in an office position which gave him a fair\\noutlook on the business, and put him in complete touch with the\\npractical side of it; yet the facts of the case made the situation\\nevident to those under him as well as his peers. Whatever convictions\\nand opinions he was maturing in this year with the Hardwicks, he kept to\\nhimself; but he was supposed to hold some socialistic ideas, and Lydia\\nSessions, James Hardwick's sister-in-law, made her devoir to these by\\nengaging zealously in semi-charitable enterprises among the mill-girls.\\nHe was a passionate individualist. The word seems unduly fiery when one\\n\\n\\nremembers the smiling, insouciant manner of his divergences from the\\nconventional type; yet he was inveterately himself, and not some\\nschoolmaster's or tailor's or barber's version of Gray Stoddard; and in\\nthis, though Johnnie did not know it, lay the strength of his charm\\nfor her.\\n\\nThe moments passed unheeded after he came into her field of vision, and\\nshe watched him for some time, busy at his morning's work. It took her\\nbreath when he raised his eyes suddenly and their glances encountered.\\nHe plainly recognized her at once, and nodded a cheerful greeting. After\\na while he got up and came out into the hall, his hands full of papers,\\nevidently on his way to one of the other offices. He paused beside the\\nbench and spoke to her.\\n\\n\\\"Waiting for the room boss? Are they going to put you on this morning?\\\"\\nhe asked pleasantly.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I'm a-going to get a chance to work right away,\\\" she smiled up at\\nhim. \\\"Ain't it fine?\\\"\\n\\nThe smile that answered hers held something pitying, yet it was a pity\\nthat did not hurt or offend.\\n\\n\\\"Yes--I'm sure it's fine, if you think so,\\\" said Stoddard, half\\nreluctantly. Then his eye caught the broken pink blossom which Johnnie\\nhad pinned to the front of her bodice. \\\"What's that?\\\" he asked. \\\"It\\nlooks like an orchid.\\\"\\n\\nHe was instantly apologetic for the word; but Johnnie detached the\\nflower from her dress and held it toward him.\\n\\n\\\"It is,\\\" she assented. \\\"It's an orchid; and the little yellow flower\\nthat we-all call the whippoorwill shoe is an orchid, too.\\\"\\n\\nStoddard thrust his papers into his coat pocket and took the blossom in\\nhis hand.\\n\\n\\\"That's the pink moccasin flower,\\\" Johnnie told him. \\\"They don't bloom\\nin the valley at all, and they're not very plenty in the mountains. I\\npicked this one six miles up on White Oak Ridge yesterday. I reckon I\\nhaven't seen more than a dozen of these in my life, and I've hunted\\nflowers all over Unaka.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I never had the chance to analyze one,\\\" observed Stoddard. \\\"I'd like to\\nget hold of a good specimen.\\n\\n\\\"I'm sorry this one's broken,\\\" Johnnie deprecated. Then her clouded face\\ncleared suddenly with its luminous smile. \\\"If it hadn't been for you I\\nreckon it would have been knocked over the edge of the road,\\\" she added.\\n\\\"That's the flower I had in my handkerchief yesterday evening.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nStoddard continued to examine the pink blossom with interest.\\n\\n\\\"You said it grew up in the mountains--and didn't grow in the valley,\\\"\\nhe reminded her.\\n\\nShe nodded. \\\"Of course I'm not certain about that,\\\" and while she spoke\\nhe transferred his attention from the flower to the girl. \\\"I really know\\nmighty little about such things, and I've not been in the valley to\\nexceed ten times in my life. Miss Baird, that taught the school I went\\nto over at Rainy Gap, had a herbarium, and put all kinds of pressed\\nflowers in it. I gathered a great many for her, and she taught me to\\nanalyze them--like you were speaking of--but I never did love to do\\nthat. It seemed like naming over and calling out the ways of your\\nfriends, to pull the flower all to pieces and press it and paste it in a\\nbook and write down all its--its--ways and faults.\\\"\\n\\nAgain she smiled up at him radiantly, and the young man's astonished\\nglance went from her dusty, cowhide shoes to the thick roll of fair hair\\non her graceful head. What manner of mill-girls did the mountains send\\ndown to the valley?\\n\\n\\\"But I--\\\" began Stoddard deprecatingly, when Johnnie reddened and broke\\nin hastily.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I don't mean that for you. Miss Baird taught me for three years,\\nand I loved her as dearly as I ever could any one. You may keep this\\nflower if you want to; and, come Sunday, I'll get you another one that\\nwon't be broken.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why Sunday?\\\" asked Stoddard.\\n\\n\\\"Well, I wouldn't have time to go after them till then, and the ones I\\nknow of wouldn't be open before Sunday. I saw just three there by the\\nspring. That's the way they grow, you know--two or three in a place,\\nand not another for miles.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You saw them growing?\\\" repeated Stoddard. \\\"I should like to see one on\\nits roots, and maybe make a little sketch of it. Couldn't you just as\\nwell show me the place Sunday?\\\"\\n\\nFor no reason that she could assign, and very much against her will,\\nJohnnie's face flushed deeply.\\n\\n\\\"I reckon I couldn't,\\\" she answered evasively. \\\"Hit's a long ways\\nup--and--hit's a long ways up.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And yet you're going to walk it--after a week's work here in the mill?\\\"\\npersisted Stoddard. \\\"You'd better tell me where they grow, and let me go\\nup in my car.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I wish't I could,\\\" said Johnnie, embarrassed. \\\"But you'd never find it\\n\\n\\nin the world. They isn't one thing that I could tell you to know the\\nplace by: and you have to leave the road and walk a little piece--oh,\\nit's no use--and I don't mind, I'd just love to go up there and get the\\nflowers for you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Are you the new girl?\\\" inquired a voice at Johnnie's shoulder.\\n\\nThey turned to find a squat, middle-aged man regarding them dubiously.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" answered Johnnie, rising. \\\"I've been waiting quite a while.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, come this way,\\\" directed the man and, turning, led her away. Down\\nthe hall they went, then up a flight of wooden stairs which carried them\\nto a covered bridge, and so to the upper story of the factory.\\n\\n\\\"That's an unusual-looking girl.\\\" Old Andrew MacPherson made the comment\\nas he received the papers from Stoddard's hands.\\n\\n\\\"The one I was speaking to in the hall?\\\" inquired Stoddard rather\\nunnecessarily. \\\"Yes; she seems to have an unusual mind as well. These\\nmountain people are peculiar. They appear to have no idea of class, and\\ntherefore are in a measure all aristocrats.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, that ought to square with your socialistic notions,\\\" chaffed\\nMacPherson, sorting the work on his desk and pushing a certain portion\\nof it toward Stoddard. \\\"Sit down here, if you please, and we'll go over\\nthese now. The girl looked a good deal like a fairy princess. I don't\\nthink she's a safe topic for susceptible young chaps like you and me,\\\"\\nthe grizzled old Scotchman concluded with a chuckle. \\\"Your socialistic\\nhullabaloo makes you liable to foregather with all sorts of\\nimpossible people.\\\"\\n\\nGray shook his head, laughing, as he seated himself at the desk beside\\nthe other.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I'm only a theoretical socialist,\\\" he deprecated.\\n\\n\\\"Hum,\\\" grunted the older man. \\\"A theoretical socialist always seemed to\\nme about like a theoretical pickpocket--neither of them stands to do\\nmuch harm. For example, here you are, one of the richest young fellows\\nof my acquaintance, living along very contentedly where every tenet you\\nprofess to hold is daily outraged. You're not giving away your money.\\nYou take a healthy interest in a good car, a good dinner, the gals; I'm\\neven told you have a fad for old porcelains--and yet you call yourself a\\nsocialist.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"These economic conditions are not a pin,\\\" answered Gray, smiling. \\\"I\\ndon't have to jump and say 'ouch!' the minute I find they prick me.\\n\\n\\nWorse conditions have always been, and no doubt bad ones will survive\\nfor a time, and pass away as mankind outgrows them. I haven't the\\ncolossal conceit to suppose that I can reform the world--not even push\\nit much faster toward the destination of good to which it is rolling.\\nBut I want to know--I want to understand, myself; then if there is\\nanything for me to do I shall do it. It may be that the present\\nconditions are the best possible for the present moment. It may be that\\nif a lot of us got together and agreed, we could better them\\nexceedingly. It is not certain in my mind yet that any growth is of\\nvalue to humanity which does not proceed from within. This is true of\\nthe individual--must it not be true of the class?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No doubt, no doubt,\\\" agreed MacPherson, indifferently. \\\"Most of the men\\nwho are loud in the leadership of socialism have made a failure of their\\nown lives. We'll see what happens when a man who is a personal and\\neconomic success sets up to teach.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If you mean that very complimentary description for me,\\\" said Gray with\\nsudden seriousness, \\\"I will say to you here and now that there is no\\npreacher in me. But when I am a little clearer in my own mind as to what\\nI believe, I shall practise. The only real creed is a manner of life. If\\nyou don't live it, you don't really believe it.\\\"\\n\\nWEAVERS AND WEFT\\n\\nThe Hardwick mill was a large one; to the mountain-bred girl it seemed\\nendless, while its clamour and roar was a thing to daunt. They passed\\nthrough the spinning department, in which the long lines of frames were\\ntended by children, and reached the weaving-rooms whose looms required\\nthe attention of women, with here and there a man who had failed to make\\na success of male occupations and sunk to the ill-paid feminine\\nactivities. In a corner of one of these, Johnnie's guide stopped before\\ntwo silent, motionless looms, and threw on the power. He began to\\ninstruct her in their operation, all communication being in dumb show;\\nfor the clapping thunder of the weaving-room instantly snatches the\\nsound from one's lips and batters it into shapelessness. Johnnie had\\nbeen an expert weaver on the ancient foot-power looms of the mountains;\\nbut the strangeness of the new machine, the noise and her surroundings,\\nbewildered her. When the man saw that she was not likely to injure\\nherself or the looms, he turned away with a careless nod and left her\\nto her fate.\\n\\nIt was a blowy April day outside, with a gay blue sky in which the white\\n\\n\\nclouds raced, drawing barges of shadow over the earth below. But the\\nnecessity of keeping dust out of the machinery, the inconvenience of\\nhaving flying ends carried toward it, closed every window in the big\\nfactory, and the operatives gasped in the early heat, the odour of oil,\\nthe exhausted air. There was a ventilating system in the Hardwick mill,\\nand it was supposed to be exceptionally free from lint; but the fagged\\nchildren crowded to the casements with instinctive longing for the\\noutdoor air which could not of course enter through the glass; or\\nplodded their monotonous rounds to tend the frames and see that the\\nthread was running properly to each spool, and that the spools were\\nremoved, when filled.\\n\\nBy noon every nerve in Johnnie's body quivered with excitement and\\noverstrain; yet when Mandy came for her at the dinner hour she showed\\nher a face still resolute, and asked that a snack be brought her to\\nthe mill.\\n\\n\\\"I don't see why you won't come along home and eat your dinner,\\\" the\\nMeacham woman commented. \\\"The Lord knows you get time enough to stay in\\nthe mill working over them old looms. Say, I seen you in the hall--did\\nyou know who you was talking to?\\\"\\n\\nThe red flooded Johnnie's face as she knelt before her loom\\ninterrogating its workings with a dexterous hand; even the white nape of\\nher neck showed pink to Mandy's examining eye; but she managed to reply\\nin a fairly even tone:\\n\\n\\\"Yes, that was Mr. Stoddard. I saw him yesterday evening when I was\\ncoming down the Ridge with Shade.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But did you know 'bout him? Say--Johnnie Consadine--turn yourself round\\nfrom that old loom and answer me, I was goin' a-past the door, and when\\nI ketched sight o' you and him settin' there talkin' as if you'd knowed\\neach other all your lives, why you could have--could have knocked me\\ndown with a feather.\\\"\\n\\nJohnnie sat up on her heels and turned a laughing face across her\\nshoulder.\\n\\n\\\"I don't see any reason to want to knock you down with anything,\\\" she\\nevaded the direct issue. \\\"Go 'long, Mandy, or you won't have time to eat\\nyour dinner. Tell Aunt Mavity to send me just a biscuit and a piece\\nof meat.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"Good land, Johnnie Consadine, but you're quare!\\\" exclaimed Mandy,\\nstaring with bulging light eyes. \\\"If it was me I'd be all in a tremble\\nyet--and there you sit and talk about meat and bread!\\\"\\n\\nJohnnie did not think it necessary to explain that the tremor of that\\nconversation with Stoddard had indeed lasted through her entire morning.\\n\\n\\\"There was nothing to tremble about,\\\" she remarked with surface calm.\\n\\\"He'd never seen a pink moccasin flower, and I gave him the one I had\\nand told him where it grew.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, he wasn't looking at no moccasin flower when I seed him,\\\" Mandy\\npersisted. \\\"He was lookin' at you. He jest eyed you as if you was Miss\\nLydia Sessions herself--more so, if anything.\\\"\\n\\nJohnnie inwardly rebuked the throb of joy which greeted this statement.\\n\\n\\\"I reckon his looks are his own, Mandy,\\\" she said soberly. \\\"You and me\\nhave no call to notice them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ain't got no call to notice 'em? Well, I jest wish't I could get you\\nand him up in front of Miss Sessions, and have her see them looks of\\nhis'n,\\\" grumbled Mandy as she turned away. \\\"I bet you there'd be some\\nnoticin' done then!\\\"\\n\\nWhen in the evening Mandy came for Johnnie, she found the new mill hand\\nwhite about the mouth with exhaustion, heavy-eyed, choking, and ready\\nto weep.\\n\\n\\\"Uh-huh,\\\" said the Meacham woman, \\\"I know just how you feel. They all\\nlook that-a-way the first day or two--then after that they look worse.\\\"\\n\\nNervelessly Johnnie found her way downstairs in the stream of tired\\ngirls and women. There was more than one kindly greeting for the new\\nhand, and occasionally somebody clapped her on the shoulder and assured\\nher that a few days more would get her used to the work. The mill yard\\nwas large, filled with grass-plots and gravel walks; but it was shut in\\nby a boarding so tall that the street could not be seen from the windows\\nof the lower floor. To Johnnie, weary to the point where aching muscles\\nand blood charged with uneliminated waste spelled pessimism, that high\\nboard fence seemed to make of the pretty place a prison yard.\\n\\nA man was propping open the big wooden gates, and through them she saw\\nthe street, the sidewalk, and a carriage drawn up at the curb. In this\\nvehicle sat a lady; and a gentleman, hat in hand, talked to her from\\nthe sidewalk.\\n\\n\\\"Come on,\\\" hissed Mandy, seizing her companion's arm and dragging her\\nforward. \\\"Thar's Miss Lydia Sessions right now, and that's Mr. Stoddard\\na-talkin' to her. I'll go straight up and give you a knockdown--I want\\nto, anyway. She's the one that runs the Uplift Club. If she takes a\\n\"\n",
